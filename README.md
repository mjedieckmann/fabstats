## What is this website?
This website is a tool to log match data from [Flesh & Bloodâ„¢](https://fabtcg.com) games.  
You can find data about scores, events, specific heroes, and more!  
Create and account to log your matches and connect to your team!  
Ultimately, the purpose of all this is to get objective and reliable data that can be used to analyze matchups, meta games, and differences between casual and competitive play.

## About the project
I started this project as a way to teach myself modern full-stack technologies.  
I pushed to create and deploy a minimal version of the website as soon as possible. For this reason, the current website is very basic, especially in terms of it's visual design.  
A list of the improvements that I am planning to implement can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1exop_D--T8YInfSe7mOj4aa1bxL14hmeg0r62cEDwwk/edit?usp=sharing).
